# Image-to-SVG

Objective
Develop a full-stack application that utilizes the StarVector model to convert user-uploaded images into SVG code. The application should expose a GraphQL API to handle image submissions and retrieval of SVG results and provide a React-based frontend for user interaction.

Core Features:

1. Image-to-SVG Conversion Using StarVector
Integrate the StarVector model to process raster images (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and generate corresponding SVG code.
Ensure the model is utilized effectively to handle vector-like images such as icons, logos, and technical diagrams, as these are the model's strengths.

2. Backend API (Python + GraphQL)
   
Implement a GraphQL API using Python frameworks like FastAPI or Flask with Graphene.
Design mutations and queries to:
Upload images for SVG conversion.
Retrieve the generated SVG code.
(optional) Implement appropriate error handling and validation for image uploads and processing.

3. Frontend (React)

Develop a React-based user interface that allows users to:
Upload images for conversion.
View the generated SVG output.
Ensure the UI provides clear feedback during the upload and conversion processes.
Display the SVG results in a user-friendly manner, possibly with options to download the SVG files.

Optional Enhancements:
Docker Containerization and Docker Compose

Dockerization:
Create Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend applications to containerize them. This ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.

Docker Compose:
Develop a docker-compose.yml file to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. This file should orchestrate the backend, frontend, and any additional services (e.g., databases, caching layers) required by the application.
Ensure inter-service communication is correctly configured within the Docker network.

OPTIONAL Bonus Points:

Caching Mechanism: Implement caching to store previously converted images and their SVG results to optimize performance and reduce redundant processing.

Authentication: Add user authentication to manage and track user submissions.

Deployment: Deploy the containerized application on a cloud platform or server, providing a live demo link.
